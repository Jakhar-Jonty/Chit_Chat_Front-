Development Pipeline:
Set Up the Project Structure:

Create the project folders for client and server sides.
Initialize the Node.js backend and React frontend with necessary dependencies (e.g., Express, MongoDB, WebSockets, JWT, React Router).
Implement User Authentication (Signup/Login):

Backend: Set up user registration and login endpoints with JWT-based authentication.
Frontend: Create signup and login forms, handle input validation, and manage authentication tokens (JWT).
Database: Design a user schema with fields for username, email, password (hashed), and other optional details.
Test Cases:
Verify successful user registration with valid input.
Test login with correct and incorrect credentials.
Ensure JWT tokens are generated and verified properly.
User Search Functionality:

Backend: Implement an endpoint to search users by username (with query filters).
Frontend: Add a search bar to find users and display results.
Test Cases:
Test search results for exact matches and partial matches.
Ensure no sensitive data is returned in search results.
Friend Request System:

Backend: Add endpoints to send, accept, and reject friend requests.
Database: Update the user schema to include a friends list and a pending requests list.
Frontend: Display options to send friend requests and manage incoming requests.
Test Cases:
Verify friend requests are sent, accepted, and rejected correctly.
Test for duplicate requests or requests to already connected friends.
Real-Time Chat Functionality:

Backend: Set up WebSockets or Socket.io for real-time communication.
Database: Design a chat schema for storing messages, timestamps, and sender/receiver info.
Frontend: Implement chat interface to display messages and send new ones in real-time.
Test Cases:
Test sending/receiving messages between friends.
Verify messages persist in the database.
Ensure chat works seamlessly across different devices.
Additional Features:

Status Indicators: Show if a user is online or offline.
Notifications: Notify users about new messages or friend requests.
Profile Management: Allow users to update their profile information.
Test Cases:
Validate status changes when users log in or out.
Test notification delivery for different events.
Ensure profile updates are saved and displayed correctly.
Security Enhancements:

Implement password hashing, rate limiting for login attempts, and secure WebSocket communication.
Regularly review code for vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
Deployment and Monitoring:

Deploy the app using services like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS.
Set up monitoring for real-time analytics and error tracking.
Testing Tools:
Backend Testing: Use tools like Jest and Postman for testing API endpoints.
Frontend Testing: Consider tools like React Testing Library and Cypress for component and end-to-end tests.
